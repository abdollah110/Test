Good to check:
get HE1-[1-4]-temperature_f  or when RM 2 is missing  -->  get HE1-[1,3-4]-temperature_f

5-12:  TimingThresholdDAC<0:7>:  8-bit threshold DAC for the timing circuit.  The
Change the TDC threshold:

put HE1-1-QIE[1-48]_TimingThresholdDAC   48*128  (can be from 0 to 255)


Shunt: 
put HE1-1-QIE[1-48]_Gsel   48*5   (can be from 0 to 31)  0 --> shunt 1,   16 --> shunt 1/6,    30 -->shunt 1/11
















Here is the description of Calibration Units and all I am learining during working on that



*LASER vs. LED: What’s the Difference?*

LED stands for Light-emitting Diode. And it’s pretty much just that. A diode that emits light when electricity passes through it.
Often in pretty colors.

LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulation of Emitted Radiation. This mouthful of gibberish pretty much means that a
source of light is amplified within a gain medium and emitted in a specific way. Cool stuff happens in the process, 
which we’ll discuss in short order. But first, we’ve got to tackle the concept of color.
