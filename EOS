How to use EOS:

source /afs/cern.ch/project/eos/installation/cms/etc/setup.sh

To gate a list:
eos ls /eos/cms/store/user/abdollah/

First of all create a subdirectory on EOS:
eos mkdir  /eos/cms/store/user/abdollah/eos_tutorial

copy the local file to your EOS directory:
xrdcp skimMuTrg_111_1_xGC.root xroot://eoscms.cern.ch//eos/cms/store/user/abdollah/eos_tutorial/skimMuTrg_111_1_xGC.root

Now, copy it back in your directory (download) from EOS:
xrdcp xroot://eoscms.cern.ch//eos/cms/store/user/abdollah/eos_tutorial/skimMuTrg_111_1_xGC.root  skimMuTrg_111_1_xGC.root
xrdcp xroot://cms-xrd-global.cern.ch//eos/cms/store/group/phys_smp/ggNtuples/13TeV/data/job_SingleMu_Run2015D_PR_25ns.root SingleMu_Run2015D_PR_25ns.root

delete afile from eos:
eos rm (-r)  /eos/cms/store/user/abdollah/Ntuple


Please note that:
xroot is the data transfer protocol
eos<experiment>.cern.ch is the host of the EOS (xroot) server
/eos/<experiment>/user/l/laman/eos_tutorial/eos.txt is the EOS full path


EOS has a quota and you can check it with the command "eos quota". Please note that you have a limit on size and on number of files.
