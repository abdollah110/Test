How to use EOS:

source /afs/cern.ch/project/eos/installation/cms/etc/setup.sh

To gate a list:
eos ls /eos/cms/store/user/abdollah/

First of all create a subdirectory on EOS:
eos mkdir  /eos/cms/store/user/abdollah/eos_tutorial

copy the local file to your EOS directory:
xrdcp skimMuTrg_111_1_xGC.root xroot://eoscms.cern.ch//eos/cms/store/user/abdollah/eos_tutorial/skimMuTrg_111_1_xGC.root
